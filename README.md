# Bazel C++ Getting Started

For my own 'template' if you will and learning bazel with external dependencies.

Basic c++ project that has:

* Command line flags via [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags)
* Logging via [glog](https://github.com/google/glog)
* Testing via [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
